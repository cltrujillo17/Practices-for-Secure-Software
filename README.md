# Secure Software Implementation â€“ Artemis Financial

This repository contains my completed artifact for the Practices for Secure Software report created as part of my coursework in CS-305: Software Security. It demonstrates how I refactored an existing Spring Boot application to implement secure communications using SSL/TLS and cryptographic hash functions. The project is based on the needs of a fictional client, Artemis Financial.

## ðŸ“„ Artifact: Practices for Secure Software Report

The selected artifact for this portfolio submission is the **Practices for Secure Software Report** from Project Two. It showcases my ability to identify software vulnerabilities, apply cryptographic hashing, enable HTTPS using self-signed certificates, and verify that my refactoring did not introduce any new vulnerabilities.

## ðŸ§  Reflection

### Who was the client and what issue did they want solved?

The client was **Artemis Financial**, a company that develops personalized financial plans for its customers. Their goal was to modernize their application and implement secure mechanisms to protect customer financial data during transmission. Specifically, they requested a file verification step using a checksum and the addition of HTTPS support.

### What did I do well in securing the code?

I successfully implemented a SHA-256 checksum generation endpoint and configured the app to use HTTPS by creating and integrating a self-signed SSL certificate. These changes ensure that both data integrity and secure transmission are enforced. Secure coding helps prevent data breaches, strengthens trust, and upholds regulatory complianceâ€”critical for any financial service.

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was most helpful or challenging?

The most helpful part was learning to use the **OWASP Dependency Check** tool to detect known CVEs in third-party libraries. The challenge was reviewing and distinguishing between inherited vulnerabilities and those introduced by new code.

### How did I increase layers of security?

I increased security by:
- Adding a hash-based file verification step
- Using SSL to encrypt traffic
- Ensuring no insecure HTTP endpoints remained active

In future projects, I would use tools like OWASP ZAP, Snyk, and static analyzers like SonarQube to evaluate vulnerabilities and help decide on mitigation strategies.

### How did I ensure the application remained functional and secure?

After refactoring, I manually tested the new `/hash` endpoint over HTTPS and verified expected output. I ran the dependency check again to confirm that **no new vulnerabilities** were introduced during the update.

### What resources or practices were helpful?

The most helpful practices included:
- Using the `keytool` CLI to generate SSL certificates
- Relying on Maven for dependency management and static security testing
- Following Spring Boot best practices for `application.properties` security configuration

These are skills I will apply to future work with secure web services.

### What would I show a future employer from this assignment?

I would show:
- My ability to integrate SSL and cryptographic hashing into a Java web application
- The vulnerability scan report before and after refactoring
- Screenshots of the functional app over HTTPS
- The written technical report that documents secure software practices

This project demonstrates both technical skills and the ability to communicate about software security clearly and professionally.
